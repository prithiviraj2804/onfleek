However, we cannot guarantee that a canceled Job will be selected by another Technician and rescheduled or that the Job Request will be completed. Technicians reserve the right to refuse a Job Request. You hereby agree to hold us harmless from any liability that may result from the cancellation of a Job or refusal of a Technician to complete a Job.

In such instances, you may be charged a minimum fee or cancellation fee.

        <h2>Inspection or Diagnosis Work </h2> We do not provide inspections that are equivalent to state inspections or SMOG inspections. Obtaining any inspection through the MechPoint Platform does not indicate that your vehicle would pass a state inspection or a SMOG inspection.

        <div class="row in_simple_terms">
            <div class="col-sm-12">

            </div>
        </div>

        If you schedule a diagnosis Job with a Technician, he or she will first seek to diagnose the problem. In performing a diagnosis, he or she may go through a step-by-step process to rule out or confirm part failures through visual inspection and/or appropriate tests. Although Technicians use their experience in performing diagnoses, we cannot guarantee that any particular diagnosis will identify all of the problems with your car (and/or solutions) during the first inspection. Sometimes, the only way to get to the root cause of a problem is to go through a process of elimination – that is, to replace a part suspected to be defective and then see whether the problem still exists.

        <div class="row in_simple_terms">
            <div class="col-sm-12">

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        After receiving a diagnosis, you may request subsequent repair work recommended based on the diagnosis. You agree that our Limited Warranty applies only to such repair work, not to the completeness of the diagnosis or to any problems that you may be experiencing with your car (other than a problem with the replaced part itself). For example, if your car has an oil leak, the leak may be coming from two or three different places in your engine. The Technician may recommend replacing the part responsible for the most obvious source of the leak, and then recheck the car to see if there are other components that are leaking too. You understand that, if there are other leaking components, replacing those other components would be separate work subject to an additional Charge.

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Pre-Service Inspection </h2> Pre-service inspections are based on what is seen and heard through the eyes and ears of the Technician. Weather and light conditions, as well as the cleanliness of the vehicle both inside and out, can reduce the accuracy of the inspection, making things such as prior repainting and body work difficult to detect. For the most accurate inspection report, the vehicle must be clean, dry and well-lit at the time of inspection. Technicians do not clean or disassemble vehicles prior to or during pre-service inspections.

        <div class="row in_simple_terms">

        </div>

        Technicians go to your location to inspect the car. They do not put the car on a lift but may use floor jacks to raise up parts of the car. Pre-service inspections are not diagnosis Jobs. Diagnostic equipment is not typically used in a pre-service inspection. Technicians may identify the VIN (vehicle identification number), but do not check the authenticity of the VIN, history, or title.

        MechPoint’s services are similar to what you would see and hear if you were to inspect the car yourself and you had the same level of experience as the Technician. Since many aspects of the inspection are subjective, the Technician is providing you with his or her opinion. If you were to perform the inspection yourself, you might come to different conclusions.

        <div class="row in_simple_terms">
            <div class="col-sm-12">

            </div>
        </div>

        Each inspection is limited to the items expressly stated in the inspection report. If you request inspection of an item not included within the inspection report, the Technician may make a reasonable effort to inspect that additional item; however, there is no guarantee that the additional item will be inspected. If reference to the additional item is not expressly included in the inspection report, you should assume that the item was not inspected.

        Technicians may test drive vehicles, but a test drive is not a required aspect of a pre-purchase inspection report.

        </div>

        Pre-purchase inspection reports are not guaranteed or warranted, because changes in the vehicle can occur and/or manifest themselves between the time of inspected and the time of purchase, and because during a pre-purchase inspection the Technician cannot see inside an engine or transmission and does not take the whole car apart to check every component in the car. Thus, impending failures may not be evident at the time of inspection.

        Neither we nor any Technician advises on the value of any vehicle, whether or not to purchase a vehicle, or authenticates a vehicle’s origin. Regardless of any comments made by a Technician, you purchase or decline to purchase a vehicle at your own risk. We do not determine if a vehicle is emission compliant or whether a vehicle will perform properly.

        <h2>Vetting of Third Party Providers </h2> Technicians may be subject to an extensive vetting process before they can register for and during their use of the MechPoint Platform, including a comprehensive criminal background check.

When interacting with Technicians, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know.
